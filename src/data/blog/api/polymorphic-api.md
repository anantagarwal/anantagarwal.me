## Introduction

APIs are the backbone of modern software systems. As applications grow, so does the need for flexibility in how data and behaviors are exposed.  
**Polymorphic APIs** offer a way to design interfaces that adapt to different types of data or requests without duplicating logic.

In this post, we’ll explore what polymorphic APIs are, why they’re useful, and some patterns you can use to design them effectively.

## What is a Polymorphic API?

In programming, *polymorphism* refers to the ability of a function, object, or interface to take on many forms.  
When applied to APIs, it means designing endpoints or contracts that can handle different resource types or behaviors while maintaining a consistent interface.

For example:

- A single `/notifications` endpoint that can send emails, SMS messages, or push notifications.  
- A `/payment` API that can process credit cards, bank transfers, or digital wallets through the same request shape.

## Introduction

APIs are the backbone of modern software systems. As applications grow, so does the need for flexibility in how data and behaviors are exposed.  
**Polymorphic APIs** offer a way to design interfaces that adapt to different types of data or requests without duplicating logic.

In this post, we’ll explore what polymorphic APIs are, why they’re useful, and some patterns you can use to design them effectively.

In this deep dive, we’ll cover:

- What polymorphic APIs are (with examples)
- How to implement them in **REST**
- Validation, documentation, and testing concerns
- Best practices and pitfalls to avoid

## What is a Polymorphic API?

In programming, _polymorphism_ refers to the ability of a function, object, or interface to take on many forms.  
When applied to APIs, it means designing endpoints or contracts that can handle different resource types or behaviors while maintaining a consistent interface.

For example: think of a payments API:

- Credit card payments
- Bank transfers
- Digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay)

You could create 3 separate endpoints

- `/credit-card-payments`
- `/bank-transfers`
- `/wallets` …

or you could design **one polymorphic endpoint** as `/payments`
